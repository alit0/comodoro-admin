### Comodoro Admin

This is a back office built with [strapi](https://strapi.io/), the node.js based headless cms.

It's part of a project in which i'm involved with some coworkers, the idea is to provide a way for a client to load content in a fashion way as though it is a wordpress blog and in parallel provide an api so that it can be consumed by a web or mobile app.
